# Quickstart

Currently, there is a [demo](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks-demo) that can be used to see how the Cluster Stack approach can work. It uses the Docker Provider Integration for Cluster API.

A proper quickstart guide will follow as soon as the OpenStack Provider Integration is completed.
