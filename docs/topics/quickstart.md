# Quickstart

Currently, there is a [demo](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stacks-demo) that can be used to see how the Cluster Stack approach can work. It uses the Docker Provider Integration for Cluster API.

For production use, the Cluster Stack Operator can be used together with the [Cluster Stack Provider OpenStack](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/cluster-stack-provider-openstack) to manage Kubernetes clusters on OpenStack. You can see how it is used in the corresponding [Quickstart Documentation](../../cluster-stacks/providers/openstack/quickstart.md) of Cluster Stacks.
